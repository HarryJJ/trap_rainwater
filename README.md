# Rainwater Trapping Algorithms Comparison

This Python script compares the performance of different algorithms for solving the rainwater trapping problem. The problem involves calculating the amount of water that can be trapped between bars given their heights. The following algorithms are implemented and compared:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**
2. **Brute Force Approach**
3. **Two Pointer Approach**
4. **Stack-Based Approach**

## Usage

1. **Requirements**: Python 3.x
2. Clone or download the script from the repository.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Script Overview

- The script defines classes for each algorithm, all inheriting from a base class `TrapRainwaterSolver`.
- Each class implements the `trap_rainwater` method to solve the problem using its respective approach.
- The script generates random heights for the bars and tests each algorithm's performance by running them 1000 times over a range of randomly generated problems.
- The average time taken for each algorithm to solve the problem over the 1000 runs is recorded and printed out.

## Results

- The script prints the average time taken for each algorithm to execute 1000 times.
- This allows for a comparison of the performance of each algorithm.

## Note

- The actual results may vary depending on the machine's performance and other factors.
- This script serves as a comparative analysis of different approaches to solving the rainwater trapping problem.
